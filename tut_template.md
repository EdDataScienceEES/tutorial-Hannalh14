## What is a Treemap?

In its most basic form, a Treemap is used to visualize proportions. Similar to a pie chart, a Treemap allows the reader to see different values as part of a whole, in this case a large rectangle instead of a circle. Treemaps are also super useful to display lots of information in a small amount of space. Using hierarchical Treemaps allow the plot to interactive and show different kinds of information. 

Treemaps can come in multiple forms ranging from very basic to very complex. Today you will be learning the most basic kind of Treemap and how to make it interactive.
