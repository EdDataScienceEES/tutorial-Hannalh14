## What is a Treemap?

In its most basic form, a Treemap is used to visualize proportions. Similar to a pie chart, a Treemap allows the reader to see different values as part of a whole, in this case a large rectangle instead of a circle. Treemaps are also super useful to display lots of information in a small amount of space. Using hierarchical Treemaps allow the plot to interactive and show different kinds of information. 

Treemaps can come in multiple forms ranging from very basic to very complex. Today you will be learning the most basic kind of Treemap and how to make it interactive.

## 1. Loading needed packages


For this tutorial you will need 5 different packages. Copy the code below into your RStudio and run it to install and load the needed package. 



`install.packages("tidyverse")`

`install.packages("treemap")`

`install.packages("dplyr")`


`install.packages("readr")`


`install.packages("d3treeR")`


`devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/d3treeR") # use this code if d3treeR does not install on the first try (remove the # to run this code)
`


Once you have installed these packages it is time to load them up. Use the code below to do that. 


`library(tidyverse)`

`library(treemap)`

`library(dplyr)`

`library(readr)`

`library(d3treeR)`

## 2. Downloading data

To get the needed data, please visit this repository. Once you have copied the repo, please set your working directory to where you saved it on your device. Use the following code to set your working directory.


`setwd("You_file_path")`

The next step in this process is to load the data from the repo and view it in your RStudio. Use the code below to do that. 

`popdata <- read.csv("us_pop_by_state.csv")` 

`view(popdata)` 

An important thing to keep in mind if you decide to make a Treemap with your own data is to make sure your data is compatable. To make a Treemap you need to have hierarchical data.Sort of like a nesting doll or an onion, data with various layers wrok well when creating Treemaps. In this tutorial you with be working with very very simple data that have very few layers.W will be using the US states and their populations recorded from the 2020 census. Something else to keep in mind if you are to use this method with your own data is to make sure the data doesn't have a total sum of your values. For example, the entire population of the US. This total can throw off the proportions of your Treemap so it is best to get rid of it. 

Below you can see an example of a Treemap if we did not get rid of the whole population of the US.

To avoid this, we need to get rid of this total in our data. That can be done with the code below. 

`statepop <- popdata %>% slice(-c(52))`
`view(statepop)`

As you can see when you view the data, the last row has been removed. 

This can also be relevant with observational data, you do not want a row that contains a sum of all of your observations.

## 3. Creating the Treemap
Now that our data is all sorted, it is time to create the Treemap. First, it is good to have an understanding of the code you will be running. We will be using the Treemap package you downloaded at the beginning of this tutorial. As you can see in the code you are going to run below, you must call both the Treemap package and the data that we sliced above. Some other important aspects to understand are what pieces of the data youa re using to create this plot."Index" is referring to the characters we are comparing, in this case it will be the US states. "vSize" is the numerical values we are comparing, in this instance it is the population from the 2020 census. Next is "type" that is just determining the color scheme used in the Treemap. Lastly, is title which is pretty self explanitory. 

The code below will result in your first Treemap! Try it out! 

`poptm <- treemap(statepop,

                  index = c("state"),
                  
                  vSize = "X2020_census",
                  
                  type= "index",
                  
                  title = "United States Population by State")`
                  
You should have gotten something that looks like this.
